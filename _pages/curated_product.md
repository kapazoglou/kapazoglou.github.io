# A curated selection of projects

* CLEAR walkthrough of visual design process and decisions (Distress MGMT / Treatment Plan)

* REAL user/product challenges (New Features vs Iterations)

* STRONG UI/UX execution (Design System)

* collaboration context, metrics, results

* IMPACT: Design System, Localisation, HTML for content (Onboarding)

## Design Process

> The following Design Process was co-developed with the Product Manager at Mika Health. 
>
>Through our collaboration we implemented a step by step pipeline with multiple stakeholder touchpoints and clear transitions from each step to the next. 
> 
> By implementing it we managed to:
> * Improve inter-departmental communication
> * Establish clear accountability
> * Get timely and explicit stakeholder buy-in
> * Smoothly fit within Tech processes such as Sprints


#### Opportunity/Problem Definition 
* stakeholder expectation management
* manage scope creep
* tackle tech debt
* prioritisation according to roadmap

> ##### Example: Distress Management
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>

#### Research
* best practices through Mobbin and competitor analysis
* AI suggestions i.e. Stitch
* In-House User Reasearch

#### Flow diagram
establish feedback loops; stakeholder buy-in; backend for feasability & prep; content for alignment; high level user testing possible

> ##### Example: Distress Management
> This was the flow diagram I designed for the Distsress Management Feature
