## Design Process with Examples

The following Design Process I developed in collaboration with the Product Manager at Mika Health. The app was focused on providing information and support to cancer patients throughout their patient journey. 

I implemented a step by step pipeline with multiple stakeholder touchpoints and clear transitions from each step to the next. 
 
Through the implementation of the Design Process we managed to:
* Improve inter-departmental communication
* Establish clear accountability
* Get timely and explicit stakeholder buy-in
* Smoothly fit within Tech processes such as Sprints
* Well documented steps that facilitate auditing processes

<br>

#### 1. Opportunity/Problem Definition & Research
Upon receiving a brief I check to see that I have all the relevant information, then note the stakeholders to loop in and clearly define the limits of the scope with them and the PM in order to avoid scope creep. The PM and I look for opportunities to minimise and combine the project with backlog issues or anything reducing tech debt. The project is then allocated a time estimate and a priority in the roadmap.

After that I start research and ideation looking at:
* best practices on Mobbin and in-house competitor analysis
* AI suggestions i.e. Stitch
* data from in-House User Reasearch & Behavioural Science

> ##### Example: Treatment Plan Best Practice Analysis
> For the purposes of a partnership as well as a grant we were required to track user adherence to medication. In order to do that we first had to lay a framework for users to add and track their medication and medical appointments in-app. This was prioritised as it was also an often requested feature from our users.

#### 2. Flow diagram
Once all the information is in place the next step is to generate a flow diagram and get it in front of the stakeholders as rapidly as possible. With this diagram as a talking point I can:
* establish feedback loops
* get stakeholder buy-in
* check with backend for feasibility & briefing them on requirements 
* align with the content team 
* perform high level user testing if necessary

The process is iterated, feedback is incorporated and documented as required.

> ##### Example: Treatment Plan Diagram
> Because of the scope of this feature, or rather feature collection, I designed a high level diagram along with a more refined object diagram in order to refine requirements with backend.

<br>

#### 3. Wireframes
Once the diagram has been agreed, the flow is then fleshed out more into wireframes where navigation and interactions start to be defined. By presenting the Wireframes I collect: 
* further stakeholder buy-in. 
* frontend comment for feasibility and agreement on Design System components and interaction patterns to be used
* QA & frontend comment on error handling and exceptions
* user feedback through user testing with clickdummies

The process is iterated, feedback is incorporated and documented as required.

> ##### Example: Treatment Plan Wireframes
> Having done the work in advance, the diagram helped us to assess the scope of the project and parr it down to a feasible MVP. From there I defined the main user actions according to the agreed requirements and created wireframes.

<br>

#### 4. Screen design
Once there is enough feedback incorporated into the wireframes, the screen design process cas start where
design system components, templates and interaction patterns are applied. These screens are then taken to refinement so that:

* We can run final user testing with full prototypes
* QA, Front- & Backend are briefed as to the requirements
* A development plan can start being formed
* Work packages can be agreed upon with specified start dates/Sprints 

The process is iterated, feedback is incorporated and documented as required.

## Reducing Friction in User Acquisition

Mika Health operated within a strict regulatory framework, requiring adherence to multiple standards, including DiGA, MDR, GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and ePA. This meant that every design and development decision had to align with legal requirements to protect patient data, ensure accessibility, and meet market approval standards.

<iframe style="border: 1px solid white;" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/X0ZgrfqI35FSQFjSucUyjs/%F0%9F%94%97-Onboarding?node-id=4001-46385&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

DiGA registration added complex onboarding that increased friction during activation; while these measures ensured compliance, they hampered user adoption, so after the business strategy moved away from DiGA the onboarding was completely overhauled to remove barriers, streamline access, boost acquisition, and deliver a user-centered redesign with smoother, more intuitive entry points.

<iframe style="border: 1px solid white;" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/X0ZgrfqI35FSQFjSucUyjs/%F0%9F%94%97-Onboarding?node-id=4001-46681&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I partnered with marketing to align messaging, user expectations, and brand positioning so acquisition funnels were optimized and the app became more accessible to a broader audience; the redesigned onboarding improved conversion rates, reduced drop-offs, and created a more intuitive entry point, demonstrating my ability to balance regulatory compliance with usability while driving strategic, scalable growth in a complex healthcare environment.

## Better Content Delivery for Measurable Outcomes

Mika Health was partnered was conducting a study into Behavioural Change Techniques (BCTs) where it was required to be able to perform AB tests between different techniques for different patients in a way that created measurable outcomes. This project was also addressing several user wishes for closer personalisation to their needs.

<iframe style="border: 1px solid white;" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/1SwD7u5Mi3GX01KsSlSvRF/%F0%9F%94%97-Distress-Management?node-id=1-17403&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In collaboration with the in-house Behavioural Scientist I translated the BCTs into modular flows that could be turned on and off in order to enable a variety of AB testing. Furthermore, the project began adressing pre-existing issues with content delivery and was seeking to increase retention by ensuring patients received the content they needed at the time they needed it in. The MVP was released as a Distress Management feature which imrpoved retention and met our partnership responsibilities

## Improving Retention through Medical Adherence
Stepping into a Lead role, I leveraged two years of hands-on UX work to address structural issues. I conducted extensive user research with to surface patient motivations and frustrations and collaborated with a behavioural psychologist to select Behavioural Change Techniques that support healthier routines; I mapped the app flow, removed duplicate entry points, dead ends, and misdirected paths, redesigned the experience into a cohesive, purposeful loop, and introduced progression and personalization techniques to sustain motivation and make the app feel increasingly tailored and rewarding.

<iframe style="border: 1px solid white;" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/1N5pVskSwQNYdU1aQlZN7y/Project-Selection?node-id=10-6593&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br>

I designed a user-centered mobile app for cancer patients to manage mental health and therapy progress, creating an intuitive calendar system to track daily recommendations, monitor therapy plans, and take actionable steps; to prevent overwhelm I implemented gentle notifications, surfaced relevant personalized recommendations, and added reward mechanisms that visually represented completed actions as progress, while weekly insights were structured to reveal meaningful patterns over time. The wireframes tested well with users and an MVP was commissioned.
