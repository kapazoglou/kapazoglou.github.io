## Design Process

The following Design Process I developed in collaboration with the Product Manager at Mika Health. The app was focused on providing information and support to cancer patients throughout their patient journey. 

I implemented a step by step pipeline with multiple stakeholder touchpoints and clear transitions from each step to the next. 
 
Through the implementation of the Design Process we managed to:
* Improve inter-departmental communication
* Establish clear accountability
* Get timely and explicit stakeholder buy-in
* Smoothly fit within Tech processes such as Sprints
* Well documented steps that facilitate auditing processes

<br>

#### 1. Opportunity/Problem Definition & Research
Upon receiving a brief I check to see that I have all the relevant information, then note the stakeholders to loop in, clearly define the limits of the scope with them and the PM in order to avoid scope creep. The PM and I look for opportunities to minimise and combine the project with backlog issues or anything reducing tech debt. The project is then allocated a time estimate and a priority in the roadmap.

After that I start research and ideation looking at:
* best practices on Mobbin and in-house competitor analysis
* AI suggestions i.e. Stitch
* data from in-House User Reasearch & Behavioural Science

> ##### Example: Treatment Plan Best Practice Analysis
> For the purposes of a partnership as well as a grant we were required to track user adherence to medication. In order to do that we first had to lay a framework for users to add and track their medication and medical appointments in-app. This was prioritised as it was also an often requested feature from our users.

#### 2. Flow diagram
Once all the information is in place the next step is to generate a flow diagram and get it in front of the stakeholders as rapidly as possible. With this diagram as a talking point I can:
* establish feedback loops
* get stakeholder buy-in
* check with backend for feasibility & briefing them on requirements 
* align with the content team 
* perform high level user testing if necessary

The process is iterated, feedback is incorporated and documented as required.

> ##### Example: Treatment Plan Diagram
> Because of the scope of this feature, or rather feature collection, I designed a high level diagram along with a more refined object diagram in order to refine requirements with backend.

<br>

#### 3. Wireframes
Once the diagram has been agreed, the flow is then fleshed out more into wireframes where navigation and interactions start to be defined. By presenting the Wireframes I collect: 
* further stakeholder buy-in. 
* frontend comment for feasibility and agreement on Design System components and interaction patterns to be used
* QA & frontend comment on error handling and exceptions
* user feedback through user testing with clickdummies

The process is iterated, feedback is incorporated and documented as required.

> ##### Example: Treatment Plan Wireframes
> Having done the work in advance, the diagram helped us to assess the scope of the project and parr it down to a feasible MVP. From there I defined the main user actions according to the agreed requirements and created wireframes.

<br>

#### 4. Screen design
Once there is enough feedback incorporated into the wireframes, the screen design process cas start where
design system components, templates and interaction patterns are applied. These screens are then taken to refinement so that:

* We can run final user testing with full prototypes
* QA, Front- & Backend are briefed as to the requirements
* A development plan can start being formed
* Work packages can be agreed upon with specified start dates/Sprints 

The process is iterated, feedback is incorporated and documented as required.

#### 5. Handover readiness
Definition of Readiness
Design System check/update; Screens for iOS & Android; Frame names, localisation keys and tokens checked & behaviour annotation versus Tech Tickets checked

> ##### Example: Distress Management
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
