# A curated selection of projects

> *Please allow a few seconds for each embedded Figma project to load. I am aware it is not the optimal user experience but it is the most straightforard way to share Figma files. Thank you for your patience*  :)

* CLEAR walkthrough of visual design process and decisions (Distress MGMT / Treatment Plan)

* REAL user/product challenges (New Features vs Iterations)

* STRONG UI/UX execution (Design System & Accessibility Guidelines & Sensitivity to Cognitive impairement)

* collaboration context, metrics, results

* IMPACT: Design System, Localisation, HTML for content (Onboarding)

> The following Design Process I developed in collaboration with the Product Manager at Mika Health. 
>
>I implemented a step by step pipeline with multiple stakeholder touchpoints and clear transitions from each step to the next. 
> 
> Through the implementation of the Design Process we managed to:
> * Improve inter-departmental communication
> * Establish clear accountability
> * Get timely and explicit stakeholder buy-in
> * Smoothly fit within Tech processes such as Sprints

## Design Process

#### 1. Opportunity/Problem Definition & Research
* stakeholder expectation management
* manage scope creep
* tackle tech debt
* prioritisation according to roadmap

* best practices through Mobbin and competitor analysis
* AI suggestions i.e. Stitch
* In-House User Reasearch & Behavioural Science

#### 2. Flow diagram
establish feedback loops; stakeholder buy-in; backend for feasability & prep; content for alignment; high level user testing possible
* iterate as needed and annotate behaviour

> ##### Example: Treatment Plan Diagram
> This was the flow diagram I designed for the Treatment Plan Feature
> <iframe style="border: 1px solid white;" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/4W5mpXGi4lT1gpFiJd5k10/%F0%9F%94%97-Treatment-Plan-Diagrams?node-id=1-17403&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br>

#### 3. Wireframes
stakeholder buy-in; frontend for feasability & prep (design system components)
user testing recommended, Clickdummy
* iterate as needed and annotate behaviour

> ##### Example: Treatment Plan Wireframes

> <iframe style="border: 1px solid white;" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/p5jXXfAPMNSAZmGhhuWwXw/%F0%9F%94%97-Treatment-Plan-Wireframes?node-id=4003-11949&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<br>

#### 4. Screen design
apply design system components, templates and interaction patterns; refinement with Front- & Backend; QA briefing; user testing recommended; Prototype;

* iterate as needed and annotate behaviour

> ##### Example: Treatment Plan Screen Design
> 
> <iframe style="border: 1px solid white;" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/design/W28UGT8CPwbK3pdXhDMV3k/%F0%9F%94%97-Treatment-Plan-Screens?node-id=4008-62401&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br>

#### 5. Handover readiness
Definition of Readiness
Design System check/update; Screens for iOS & Android; Frame names, localisation keys and tokens checked & behaviour annotation versus Tech Tickets checked

> ##### Example: Distress Management
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
