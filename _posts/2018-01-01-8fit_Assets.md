I collaborated with content managers to create clear, engaging vector illustrations that explained anatomical structures and physiological processes in an accessible way for fitness app users.

I ensured visual consistency with the appâ€™s branding and user interface.


The illustrations helped users understand their body mechanics, making fitness guidance more engaging and actionable. By balancing precision with clarity, I transformed technical knowledge into visually intuitive learning experiences.


<!--The task was to design well perfoming Facebook/Instagram ads for the fitness app. I came up with the concepts after research and animated the ads.
