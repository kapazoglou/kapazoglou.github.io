The healthcare app operated within a strict regulatory framework, requiring adherence to multiple standards, including DiGA, MDR, GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and ePA. This meant that every design and development decision had to align with legal requirements to protect patient data, ensure accessibility, and meet market approval standards.

DiGA registration introduced particularly intricate onboarding flows, including a mail-based code verification process, which added friction to user activation. While these stringent processes ensured compliance, they also posed challenges for user adoption. 

After the business strategy shifted away from DiGA registration, the app’s onboarding flow required a complete overhaul. The focus shifted to reducing barriers for new users, streamlining access, and improving acquisition rates. This transformation was not just about technical improvements—it required a user-centered redesign to ensure smooth, intuitive entry points.

Recognizing that onboarding is not just a technical challenge but also a key driver of user engagement, I worked closely with the marketing team to align messaging, user expectations, and brand positioning. This collaboration ensured that new acquisition funnels were optimized, making the app more accessible to a broader audience.

The new onboarding system led to higher conversion rates, reduced drop-offs, and a more intuitive entry point for users. By balancing regulatory compliance with usability and strategic growth, this project showcases my ability to navigate complex healthcare regulations while optimizing user experience for scalability.
