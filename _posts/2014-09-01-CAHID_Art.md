At the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification, I collaborated across multiple faculties to create illustrations and animations that enhanced anatomical education and research. Each project focused on a single anatomical topic, ensuring clarity and depth in its visual representation.

My illustrations would be visualizing complex anatomical structures, making them more accessible to students and researchers.

One of the most intricate areas I worked on involved head and neck anatomy, demanding extreme attention to detail to balance scientific accuracy with artistic interpretation. My illustrations explored vascular systems, emphasizing the interwoven relationships between arteries and veins which are vital in both surgical procedures and anatomical education. This work required a deep understanding of circulatory pathways and tissue interactions, ensuring that medical professionals could use the visuals as functional references.

At the intersection of artistic anatomy and medical anatomy, the challenge was to create illustrations that were visually compelling yet anatomically precise.

In artistic anatomy—used in fine art, animation, and sculpture—the emphasis often leans towards surface forms, muscular tension, and expressive movement, shaping an understanding of anatomy that prioritizes aesthetics. In contrast, medical anatomy requires detailed internal structures, layered compositions, and technical accuracy, focusing on clinical relevance and surgical applications.

A significant portion of my work involved documenting cadaver-based studies, which are fundamental to medical education, forensic research, and anatomical advancements.

These illustrations explored the delicate process of dissecting and preserving the human form, capturing the layered complexity of anatomy and the transition between life and decay. Through careful observation and sketching, I translated these fleeting moments into visual records, balancing scientific accuracy with the emotional weight of mortality.

The act of sketching—whether in a sterile laboratory or an unfiltered moment of quiet reflection—allowed me to engage with these subjects in a way that was both technical and deeply introspective, bridging the space between clinical detachment and artistic interpretation.

Sketching was essential in refining my 3D modeling skills, helping me grasp form, proportion, and spatial relationships before translating them into digital reconstructions. When working with CT data, sketching allowed me to better interpret layered anatomical structures, ensuring that the digital models accurately represented depth and detail.

By visually capturing real anatomical specimens, these projects helped bridge the gap between theoretical learning and hands-on application, making anatomy more accessible and comprehensible for both students and researchers.
