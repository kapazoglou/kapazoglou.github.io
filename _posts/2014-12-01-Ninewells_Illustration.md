As a resident photographer at Ninewells Hospital, I was responsible for documenting patient ailments and surgical procedures through medical photography for patient records and educational purposes.

My role required technical expertise and ethical responsibility, ensuring images were accurately captured to support medical documentation and teaching, handled with discretion to maintain strict patient confidentiality, and executed under sterile conditions in accordance with surgical protocols.

By capturing hundreds of patient cases and dozens of surgical procedures, I contributed to enhancing surgical learning materials while providing essential visual records for healthcare professionals, ensuring that all sensitive information was securely managed with the highest standards of medical ethics and professionalism.
