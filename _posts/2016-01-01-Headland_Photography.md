Following an excavation in Blackburn, I worked with Headland Archaeology Ltd to create high-precision 3D models of four excavated skulls while also conducting technical photography of various archaeological finds.

The 3D modeling of skulls ensured accurate preservation of their anatomical structure, providing detailed digital records for analysis and further study.

At the same time, technical photography captured human remains, flint-knapped tools, and other excavated finds, offering valuable insights into past cultural practices and craftsmanship.

By combining digital modeling with photographic documentation, I helped create comprehensive records that enhance both academic research and public understanding of the excavation. This approach ensured that the discoveries were archived, studied, and interpreted with both scientific precision and historical sensitivity.
