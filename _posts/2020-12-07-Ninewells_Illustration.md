A surgeon at Ninewells Hospital commissioned a set of illustrations to show the patients journey through surgery and the WHO Surgical Checklist. I produced these illustrations as quick sketches in the theatre and I kept them deliberately impressionistic because their purpose was to give the patient a general understanding of the main steps they would be taken through.
