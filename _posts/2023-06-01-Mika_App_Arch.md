Stepping into a Lead position was a pivotal moment in my journey with this healthcare app. Having already spent a couple of years refining its user experience, I had an intimate understanding of its strengths and shortcomings. This leadership role provided me with the autonomy to tackle deeper structural issues, guiding a team toward meaningful improvements. 

My first priority was extensive user research which was conducted with the help of a user researcher. Engaging directly with patients allowed us to uncover deep insights into their habits, motivations, and frustrations. From there, with the help of a behavioural psychologist, I identified Behavioural Change Techniques that could support users in forming healthier routines.

As I analyzed the app’s flow, I discovered duplicate entry points, dead ends, and misdirected user paths—pain points that were disrupting engagement. My solution was to redesign the experience into a cohesive loop, ensuring every interaction felt purposeful and beneficial. To maintain user motivation, I developed progression techniques that simultaneously increased personalization, making the app feel more tailored and rewarding over time.

The project focus was designing a user-centered mobile app experience for managing mental health and therapy progress for cancer patients. My goal was to create an intuitive calendar-based system where users could easily track their daily recommendations, monitor therapy plans, and take actionable steps toward improvement.

One of the core challenges was ensuring users engaged with daily content without feeling overwhelmed. I designed a system that offered gentle notifications, surfaced relevant recommendations, and allowed personalization so that users could tailor their experience to their specific needs.

To reinforce motivation, I incorporated reward mechanisms—each completed action was visually represented as progress, helping users feel accomplished. Weekly insights were structured in a way that divided data meaningfully, ensuring users could recognize patterns and improvements over time.

Leveraging the platform’s expansive content library, I mapped out ways to enhance accessibility and pinpointed new opportunities for expansion. A user-centric approach guided my decision-making, prioritizing transparent and supportive design principles to avoid predatory flow structures.

This project challenged me to blend UX research, behavioral design, information architecture, and ethical user flows into a seamless and impactful experience.
