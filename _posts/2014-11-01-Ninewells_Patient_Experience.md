A surgeon at Ninewells Hospital commissioned me to create a series of illustrations depicting the patient's journey through surgery and the WHO Surgical Checklist with a focus on enhancing patient understanding and comfort. To improve the user experience, I produced quick, impressionistic sketches directly in the operating theatre, ensuring the visuals were intuitive, non-intimidating, and easy to follow.

The illustrations guided patients through pre-surgical preparations, key surgical stages, and post-operative care, offering a clear and approachable visual reference. By emphasizing consent, anesthesia protocols, procedural flow, and recovery milestones, the designs helped patients feel more informed, prepared, and reassured about their medical journey. The artwork also reinforced safety measures outlined in the WHO Surgical Checklist, improving transparency and supporting a better healthcare experience.

This project highlighted the importance of thoughtful visual communication in medical settings, ensuring that complex procedures were accessible, patient-friendly, and engaging.
