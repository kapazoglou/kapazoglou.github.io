As part of the Virtual Health Pioneers incubator, I provided design leadership to a promising healthcare start-up, helping them shape their minimum viable product (MVP) into a scalable, user-friendly solution.

To ensure flexibility and consistency, I developed an atomic design system, creating reusable components and templates that streamlined the productâ€™s evolution. This approach enabled the team to quickly iterate on new features while maintaining a cohesive visual language.

Recognizing the need for efficiency in a fast-paced start-up environment, I introduced an iterative design-to-development process, fostering seamless collaboration between designers and engineers. This agile methodology allowed for rapid prototyping, testing, and refinement, ensuring that the product remained user-centered while meeting technical requirements.

Beyond design, I contributed to user research, helping the team gather critical feedback from early adopters. By translating user needs into actionable design improvements, I ensured that the product aligned with real-world healthcare workflows and enhanced patient engagement.

Through these initiatives, the start-up gained a strong design foundation, allowing them to scale effectively while maintaining usability and consistency. The iterative process helped reduce development bottlenecks and ensured that user insights guided product evolution.
