For this short stop-motion animated film, I designed and constructed scaled-down sets inspired by northern Greek architecture, ensuring authenticity in both structural details and visual atmosphere.

Using a collection of architectural references, I meticulously built the sets to capture traditional materials, textures, and spatial composition. The goal was to preserve the distinctive aesthetic and character of the region while ensuring the miniatures were functional for animation.

Beyond set construction, I planned and animated camera movement, ensuring that each frame conveyed the right perspective, depth, and cinematic flow. I also created auxiliary animation elements, enhancing the scene's immersive storytelling through subtle environmental interactions.

This project blended architectural research, craftsmanship, and animation techniques to create a visually compelling stop-motion world, bringing the spirit of northern Greek design into the realm of storytelling.
