Headland was publishing a monograph about excavations around Aberdeen. I designed the infographics and illustrations for the book and then typeset and prepared it to be sent to print.

I also designed some publications for internal circulation:

The back-cover of the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists Catalog has a full page ad space that Headland purchased. I put together this design based on a concept that the directors of the company were keen on and I made sure it would print well. 

Some additional marketing designs I did for Headland is this pop-up card of a derelict abbey from one of their projects:

and some informational posters for internal circulation:
