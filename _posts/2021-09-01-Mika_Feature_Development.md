This healthcare app was specifically designed to support cancer patients by addressing their unique challenges throughout treatment. My approach combined user needs, business strategy, and pharmaceutical partner considerations to create a holistic tool that enhances both emotional well-being and treatment adherence.

##### Distress Tracking

Recognizing the emotional toll of cancer treatment, I built a feature that allows patients to log and monitor their distress levels using established standards for patient reported outcomes. This data helps both patients and healthcare providers identify patterns and intervene when needed.

##### Distress Management

Beyond tracking, the app offers strategies and resources to help patients cope with their emotional and psychological challenges, including guided exercises, educational materials, and direct access to professional support.

##### Treatment Management

To streamline care, I developed tools that help patients track medications, appointments, and treatment milestones. By integrating reminders and check-ins, I ensured that patients could stay on top of their treatment plans with ease.

##### Treatment Support & Adherence

Supporting medication adherence was a priority, so I implemented personalized reminders, progress tracking, and engagement features to help patients stick to their prescribed regimen. These enhancements contributed to better health outcomes and strengthened collaboration between patients and healthcare providers

This work exemplifies the power of empathetic, patient-centered design in healthcare. By combining clinical considerations with user experience best practices, I created tools that not only meet regulatory and business requirements but also provide tangible support, reassurance, and guidance for patients navigating their treatment journey.
