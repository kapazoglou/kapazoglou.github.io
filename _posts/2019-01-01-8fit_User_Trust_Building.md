During internally turbulent times, 8fit was losing the trust of its prospective users which was only made worse with an unfortunate data breach

The challenge was to regain user trust, reduce negative reviews, improve company image as well as a soft pivot and rebrand. In collaboration with BI we revised our user personas and designed a brand that would resonate with them. This included an audit of the existing brand and the creation of guidelines. The new brand aligned with the revised value proposition from the OKRs and has managed to grow consistently across all of its applications. The new brand helped to stabilise the product.

Following user feedback, we audited the paywall as well as it’s position in the site map, which at the time was only available to the user when they attempted to access the meal plan. We requested a review of the value proposition and the pricing structure to be included in the quarter’s OKRs. We then tested the current paywall with users to identify missing information.

We designed a new and improved paywall addressing the friction points we identified in the user journey and the customer reviews. We added a clear comparison between the different subscriptions and as much information about plan pricing as we could, including an FAQ. After its release, the number of one-star reviews dropped significantly.
