During my residency at Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design (MOME) Budapest, I explored frame-by-frame sand animation, creating visuals synchronized to music by shaping, shifting, and layering grains of sand to form fluid imagery that evolved with the rhythm and mood of the soundtrack.

Each frame was crafted by hand, ensuring seamless transitions while harmonizing movement with the musical composition, requiring intuitive timing, layered textures, and experimental storytelling to echo beats, melodies, and tonal shifts. This meticulous process allowed me to merge physical craftsmanship with digital refinement, shaping an immersive artistic experience that blended organic materials, rhythm, and animation principles into a cohesive visual language.
