I have written a book, currently pending publication, which is an astronomical anthology of Greek myths. Below you can see an excerpt from the Foreword along with the data visualisations I created to help me while researching the mythographic sources.

> This is a collection of stories from Greek mythology that have all something to do with constellations or other astronomical objects. They are presented in an order that may conjure up a sequential narrative rather than as an alphabetic compilation, but they may also be read out of order.

> Ancient peoples looked up at the starry sky and saw a myriad bright points. Between stars that appear relatively close to each other, early astronomers imagined lines and so figured out the constellations. Those lines united hundreds of celestial bodies into a couple dozen shapes that were easier to recognise and remember, especially when some story, preexisting or just invented, provided a mnemonic framework for the figures. Therefore not just stars but entire groups of stars were related to one another through the names attributed to the constellations, in the full breadth of relationships of the ancients’ lived reality, which they also projected onto their deities. Names of gods and monsters, heroes and villains and all kinds of creatures were shown caught in power struggles, in alliance or at odds with one another, being in love, and through love, though not always, sharing kinship—the ancient Greeks had indeed thought of generative union as one of the primordial forces under the name of primal Eros.

> And so an alternative way to organise the constellations emerged, through the characters they stand for. By using names as starting points and drawing lines between them a genealogy was figured out. These lines united dozens of names into families, making them easier to recognise and remember, often providing further context to their stories and serving as pathways for an exploration of Greek myth. Additionally, this family tree engendered a sense of time, or at least timing, as some names had to precede others simply due to their blood relation. This meant there was a sequence that could be traced from the earliest creation myths down to some of the most well known heroic deeds.
