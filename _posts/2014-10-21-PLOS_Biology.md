I provided scientific illustrations for the PLOS Biology article From “Silent Teachers” to Models, which explores the role of embalmed cadavers in anatomical education and surgical training. The article discusses how traditional formaldehyde-based embalming limits flexibility, while newer techniques, such as Thiel embalming, allow cadavers to serve as realistic models for medical research and training.

This project required a balance of technical accuracy and engaging storytelling, ensuring that complex anatomical concepts were accessible to researchers, educators, and students. By collaborating with authors and editors, I created clear, informative visuals that enhanced the article’s impact.
