I have always loved board games and I think they are the perfect design project that combines all the skills of a good designer.

Combinatorial fascination and the thin line between cards and dominoes led me to build a game system which I then playtested and produced in a small run.

I believe designing board games enhances UX skills by refining interaction design, user engagement, and strategic thinking. It teaches intuitive mechanics, immersive experiences, and balancing challenge with accessibility. Core principles like progress tracking, reward systems, and structured play improve usability in digital design. Continuous playtesting and iteration ensure seamless interactions. These insights make UX design more engaging, structured, and user-centered. I applied those principles during COVID-19 and produced a game designed I entered into a competition.

The Zenobia Award is a prestigious competition that recognizes board games with historical themes, designed by individuals from underrepresented groups in the industry. Established in 2020, it aims to promote diversity in game design by providing mentorship and funding to finalists. One notable entry is Molly House, a game by Jo Kelly that explores the underground queer culture of early 18th-century London, where "molly houses" served as safe spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals.

The experience brought me full circle to a project I did many years before for my BA thesis.
